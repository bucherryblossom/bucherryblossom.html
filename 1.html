  <h3>Louisa May Alcott</h3>
  There are some natures <strong>too <u>noble</u> to curband</strong> and too lofty to bend.
  <p>Little Women is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott (1832–1888) which was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869.
  Alcott wrote the book over several months at the request of her publisher.</p>
  <p>The story follows the lives of the four March sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—and details their passage from childhood to womanhood.
  It is loosely based on the lives of the author and her three sisters.</p>
